# MicroPost

This is a CRUD project referring to the final project in an [online tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) created by my favorite online instructor, Brad Traversy.

The project uses a json server to mimic a backend server, and it has a website as a frontend to display/create/edit/delete posts.

## Dependencies
1. npm
    - Check if npm is installed by running `npm -v`
2. node_modules
    - Install dependencies by running `npm install`
3. json-server
    - After installing dependencies, run `npm run json:server` in the background to mimic a backend server.


## Open `index.html` or Run Live Server!
